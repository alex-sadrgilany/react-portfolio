# React Portfolio

## Description

This project was created in order to utilize the React Application to create a dynamic single page Portfolio. The portfolio takes advantage of react-router-dom to render different components based on what a user clicks in the navbar. The application also uses one component as a template to fill with specific information within another component (Project -> Portfolio components). The content of this application is mostly placeholders, save for the projects that are all mine. A proper resume will be created and uploaded in the future, along with a proper about me.
